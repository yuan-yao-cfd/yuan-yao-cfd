      <description>&lt;p&gt;Isuzu is continuously moving more and more towards virtual calibration and model based development. As part of this process, having a predictive cooling system model of a vehicle is fundamental. A predictive model of the cooling system will not only enable us to understand how it behaves under real operating conditions, but improve the boundary conditions we use to model other aspects of the powertrain and vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student team will develop and complete 1D and 3D vehicle cooling system models for Isuzuâ€™s Model Based Engine Development. Once validated the model will used for analytic sizing of coolant pumps and radiators, predicting heat rejection for the engine cylinder and thermal analysis of full vehicle cooling system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The predictive cooling system model will be an indispensable component of Isuzu full vehicle model based system. The full vehicle system will be used for Isuzu engine virtual calibration and full vehicle model based development.&lt;/p&gt;
